# AndroidBusApp
 Public bus app for android. Created in 2015 and no longer active.


I decided to create this app after missing the bus too often.  The small city I lived in had no public transportation apps or information so while waiting for the bus I was never sure if the bus was really late or if I had already missed it.

I contacted the city and they were really excited about a potential app.  They set up a public API and I created the app.

I created this app with no Java or Android training.  It was a real learning process and I am proud it even worked.

After moving from the city and working full time, I did not maintain the app so I removed it from the app store.
